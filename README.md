# NeuralNetworks
Basic Neural Network models built using Numpy and TensorFlow.
The alg_diff folder contains a pure Numpy approach with derivitives calculated by hand.
The auto_diff folder contains an implementation using TensorFlow's automatic differentiation and a decorator syntax for easily creating new activation layers.
